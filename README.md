# ERSapplication
ERS is a company reimbursement system application where employees can request reimbursements and Finance managers can approve or deny those requests.
The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company.
Users can use the application's login portal to sign into their personal account and access the different services of the application. If a user doesn't already have an account, s/he can register via the registration form; if a user put in wrong credentials they will be redirected to the unsuccessful login page.
